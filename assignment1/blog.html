        <h1>My Reflection</h1>
        <h2>Assignment 1 (Oct 8, 2024):</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</h4></li>
            <p>Having never worked with HTML before, this assignment was entirely new to me. I faced significant challenges, particularly with formatting my webpage correctly and adding an image. Understanding how to use basic HTML tags like paragraphs tag, and ensuring proper indentation and structure was confusing at first. Additionally, I struggled to add an image, as I was not familiar with the image tag or how to correctly specify file paths. To overcome these challenges, I reviewed online tutorials and the lecture notes provided in class</p>
            <li><h4>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h4></li>
            <p>From this assignment, I learned the fundamentals of HTML, including how to structure a webpage using tags. I gained a better understanding of how elements are embedded and how file paths are used to link images or other resources. One tip that I have for myself is to have the webpage opened up while editting so that I can view the output as I code.</p>
            <li><h4>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h4></li>
            <p>The most helpful resource for me in completing this assignment was the lecture notes. They provided clear instructions and examples of basic HTML tags, which helped me understand how to structure and format my webpage.</p>
