        <h4>Major: Computer Science with a focus in AI </h4>
        <h4>Year of study: Sophomore </h4>
        <h2>About me:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><h4>What is the most complex or interesting thing you've done with your current web development skills?</h4></li>
                <p> Honestly, as I approach this project, I have little to no experience with web development skills.</p>

                <li><h4>What do you hope to learn from this class?</h4></li>
                <p> I hope to gain a strong foundation in web development, learning how to design and build functional, user-friendly websites. I'm particularly excited to develop my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and understand how to create responsive and dynamic web pages.</li></p>

                <li><h4>Have you signed up for our course Campuswire forum?</h4></li>
                <p> In the lecture, it was mentioned that Ed Discussions has replaced the Campuswire forum. I currently use Ed for discussions.</p>

                <li><h4>A description of the most interesting fact about you or the most unique experience you've had.</h4></li>
                <p> One of the most unique experiences I've had was attending Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios Singapore. The artists there jump-scared me throughout the night, making it a thrilling and terrifying experience in the best way possible!</li></p>
